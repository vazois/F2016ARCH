The simulator is designed using Python 2.7.6. It takes as input up to 4 arguments but it can function with at least one.
The mandatory argument is the trace-filename. If the use provides only that the simulator run on default-configuration for the cache
which are 64K cache, 32B line, 2-way associative.

So there are two modes of execution which are shown in the following examples

python cache_sim.py gcc-10K.memtrace //default cache configuration

python cache_sim.py gcc-10K.memtrace 256K 32 2 // custom cache configuration (256K capacity, 32 line size, 2 way associative)

For the custom cache configuration, the first input is the size of the cache(K and M to distinguish between KB and MB, no letter assumed Bytes),
the line size in bytes, the associativity.
If you want to have fully associative cache set to 0 the associativity argument.

Note:
1) For the large trace, the fully associative cache takes a long time to simulate.
2) There are two LRU implementations. Change the listLRU variable in cache_sim.py to switch between implementations.
With listLRU = True the simulation is faster. The miss rate might change but the difference in percent is not that
significant. Look at the report for more details.
